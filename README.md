🛸 Linear Clone: High-Fidelity UI Practice
A pixel-perfect, monochromatic reproduction of the Linear landing page. This project was developed as a deep-dive into modern CSS architecture, responsive grid systems, and the "infinite black" design language characteristic of top-tier SaaS products.

🚀 Key Features
Sticky Glassmorphism Header: A navigation bar that remains fixed at the top with a backdrop-filter blur effect for a premium feel.

Precision Layouts: Replicated the complex, data-rich grid systems of the original site, including the dense footer and testimonial cards.

Advanced CSS: Extensive use of CSS Variables (Custom Properties), Flexbox, and CSS Grid to ensure alignment and scalability.

Performance Focused: Lightweight, dependency-free code optimized for smooth scrolling and fast load times.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Development
Frontend: HTML5 & CSS3 (Native).

Workflow: Developed as a learning practice to bridge the gap between static design and interactive web interfaces.

AI Collaboration: Built with Gemini (AI-assisted development) to troubleshoot complex layout logic and refine the monochromatic color palette.
