Linear Website Clone 🚀
A high-fidelity frontend reproduction of the Linear landing page. This project was built as a learning practice to master advanced CSS techniques and modern UI design patterns.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Development Process
Frontend: HTML5 and CSS3 (Flexbox, CSS Grid).

AI Collaboration: This project was developed with the assistance of Gemini, an AI collaborator, to troubleshoot complex layouts, refine CSS logic, and optimize code structure.

Learning Goals: Focused on implementing "pixel-perfect" design, managing global CSS variables, and building sticky, glassmorphism navigation.

✨ Key Features
Sticky Navigation: A semi-transparent header with backdrop-filter that remains fixed during scrolling.

Refined Layout: Replicated the dense, data-rich grid systems found in professional SaaS landing pages.

Minimalist Aesthetics: Emphasized the "infinite black" monochromatic look characteristic of modern tech brands.

🚀 Purpose
This repository serves as a showcase of my frontend development progress and my ability to leverage AI tools to build production-quality web interfaces.
